There are fancier bakeries out there. Ones that dip strawberries in gold, or bake mille-feuille that looks like glass. You won’t find that here.

At August Bakery, we only do bread and sandwiches. Not because we lack imagination—but because we believe in mastery. There’s a kind of sacred weight to doing one thing, and doing it well. Our sourdough starter has been alive longer than most of our ovens. Every crust, every crumb, every slice of ham tucked between white bread—it's all intentional.

It wasn’t always this way. Our founder, Mira August, started in a rented kitchen in the summer of 1983, baking baguettes and ciabattas before sunrise and delivering them door-to-door by bicycle. Her only rule was: if you’re going to make something simple, make it exceptional.

She didn’t sell sweets, even when asked. “Bread is already sweet,” she’d say. “You just have to bake it slow enough to notice.”

Sandwiches came later—when Mira was delivering bread and a regular customer joked, “I just want you to put it all together for me.” The first was a tomato sandwich, still warm from the garden, with a swipe of salt butter. That customer cried. We’ve been doing sandwiches ever since.

We bake our bread every morning in small batches. We roast and slice our meats by hand. Our vegetables come from nearby farms, or our own backyard in the summer months. There are no frozen loaves here. Nothing vacuum-sealed.

We don’t serve everything. We serve only what we can make the right way. And that, we believe, is enough.

So no, you won’t find croissants here. No cakes. No pastries dusted with powdered sugar like snowfall. But you will find a grilled cheese that hits your heart like home. A rye loaf that smells like your grandmother’s kitchen. A place where bread isn’t just a side dish. It’s the beginning.

Welcome to August.
