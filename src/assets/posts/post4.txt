We bake for mornings.

Not just the bright ones. Not just the quiet ones. We bake for the chaotic, the rushed, the bleary-eyed mornings when you’re halfway out the door and realize you forgot to eat. We bake for the mornings where everything is still.

Every loaf at August is ready by 7:30am. Still warm, if you come early. Because we believe in the power of bread to anchor a day.

There’s something about that first bite of toast—how the crust crunches just enough to wake you, how the inside stays soft like a held breath. Or the first sandwich of the day, wrapped with care and still smelling faintly of the oven.

Our morning menu is simple on purpose:

- Toasted cheddar and egg sandwiches on focaccia

- Freshly cut tomato with olive oil on rye

- White bread with blackberry jam from the neighbor’s garden

If you show up late, we won’t scold you. But we can’t promise there’ll be any left. That’s the nature of real bread—it’s made in small numbers, and it disappears the way morning does. Quietly, and too soon.

So whether you take it to-go, or sit down with a cup of something hot, just know: we baked it for you.
For your morning.

And we’ll be here again tomorrow.
