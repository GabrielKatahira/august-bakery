It starts the moment the dough breathes.

People think crust is about baking time or temperature. And yes, that matters. But the real secret? It’s what happens before it ever reaches the oven.

A crust is a story told in tension—between air and flour, water and flame. At August Bakery, we’ve spent decades refining the balance.

We use slow fermentation, often over 18 hours, to let the natural sugars and acids develop. When you bite into our sourdough, that crackle isn’t just sound—it’s memory. A crust formed not by force, but by patience.

Our ovens use stone decks, not steel trays. Why? Because stone holds heat like a secret. It creates what’s called “oven spring”—a sudden burst of rise when dough hits heat. That burst gives the crust its lift and those beautiful micro-blisters on the outside.

We steam our loaves too. Not a lot. Just enough. Steam keeps the outer layer from hardening too fast, so the bread can rise fully before setting. Then, once it bakes dry, the crust caramelizes—not burnt, not soft, but golden and full of character.

The type of flour plays its part too. We use unbleached, stone-ground flour that holds onto its natural oils and flavors. It makes for a crust that isn’t just a shell—but an extension of the loaf itself.

Some people peel the crust off. And that’s okay. But to us, the crust is the signature. It’s the part of the bread that faced the fire and came through golden. It’s where the bakery lives.

That crackle you hear when you tear open a fresh loaf?
That’s not just a sound.
That’s the sound of the day beginning.
