We get asked a lot—what’s the best sandwich you make?

The truth is, there’s no right answer. Because a good sandwich isn’t just about what’s inside. It’s about where you eat it. It’s who packed it for you. It’s whether the bread holds up when you eat it in the car, with the windows down and the sun in your lap.

Still, we have our opinions.

First: the bread does most of the work. If your sandwich is soggy, flimsy, or falling apart, it doesn’t matter how good the filling is. That’s why every loaf at August is made with the sandwich in mind. Some hold crunch. Some hold softness. All hold purpose.

Second: balance. We don’t overload our sandwiches. We don’t need to. A slice of roasted turkey, a whisper of rosemary aioli, pickled onion, crisp romaine—and you’ve got something complete. You should taste every piece.

Third: trust. Our sandwiches aren’t engineered by a committee. They’re made by people who remember the ones their parents packed in foil, or the ones they shared in late summer with someone they liked but didn’t know how to tell.

Sandwiches aren’t fancy. They’re intimate. They show who we are when we’re hungry and honest. And that’s why we love them.

So what makes a good sandwich?

You do. You bring the appetite, the history, the meaning. We just give you something real to put between your hands.
